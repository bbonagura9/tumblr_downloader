# Tumblr pictures crawler/downloader

This application receives a public Tumblr name and start downloading
the full resolution picture files until the last page. It can generate
big volumes of output data.

## Example

`$ python download_tubmlr.py some-tumblr-i-love`

## DISCLAIMER

This is not an official Tumblr application and maybe its use
is not even authorized by them. So use it by your own risk.

Furthermore, the application purpose is for those who still lives in a
decade ago and don't trust too much in the cloud, usually downloading
lots of data to **keep for themselves**. Please don't use this application
nor for copyright violation purposes, neither for unauthorized personal
image reproduction or reuse.

I just love some works exposed in Tumblr and want to keep them as a
personal collection. If you want the same, feel free to use and modify
this application.
